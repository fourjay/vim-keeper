INTRODUCTION                                *keeper*

Keywordprg is useful, but hasn't aged well. It works well for C
and for shell scripts, but rarely used in any other context.
Shelling out is also awkward, typical workflow might well involve
several screen flips (triggering the keywordprg each time). The
documentation is not easily copied and manipulated with vim tools.
And finally it's awkward in one of the most common scenarios, writing
new code, exploring keywords that are not already typed on the page.
